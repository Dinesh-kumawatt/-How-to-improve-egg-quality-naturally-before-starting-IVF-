Egg quality is very important for IVF success. If egg is weak, embryo may not grow well. But the good thing is, you can do a few things to improve egg health before IVF.

First, eat a healthy diet â€“ more green vegetables, fruits, nuts like almonds and walnuts, and food rich in iron and folate. Avoid fried food, smoking, and alcohol.

Second, take antioxidants like CoQ10, Vitamin D, and Omega-3. These help cells repair and improve egg function.

Third, get enough sleep, reduce stress with yoga, meditation, or walking. Stress hormones can disturb egg production. Also, regular but moderate exercise improves blood flow to ovaries.

Avoid plastics and chemicals that harm hormones. And take advice from a fertility doctor â€“ donâ€™t just depend on Google.
